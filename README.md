## Description

This site allows users to play a perfect generic word guessing game, where they will guess letters to fill out the hidden word. The player loses when they run out of guesses and wins when they complete the word. They're are two modes: Easy, which features random six letter words and eight guesses; and Hard, which gives you five guesses instead. It also may or may not be literally impossible.
